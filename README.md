## Acknowledgments 🙏

- I got the color theme from [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) dropdowns, so thanks to them 🙏.

- I used css `grid-template-rows` for smooth transitions between open and closed panels. I got that idea from Kevin Powell's [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_n4YONte5A&t=3s) on that topic, so thanks to him for that 🙏.
